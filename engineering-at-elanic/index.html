        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Here at Elanic, we built our iOS app using react-native (RN). When we started 7 months ago, RN was a relatively new framework and the decision to use it wasn't very clear cut. Ultimately, it came down to our need to launch an iOS app quickly and the ability for the rest of the team to contribute code. After 4 months of learning and building, we released our iOS app in November. Today, I'd like to share some of the lessons we learned using RN to develop an Indian e-commerce application.  </p>

<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>

<p>We already had a native android <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.elanic.app&amp;hl=en">app</a> so our primary concern was whether the react native ecosystem was mature enough to support all the external support SDKs that we use such as AppsFlyer, MixPanel, Social login (FB, Google), PayTM, etc. Luckily, there were plugins available for most of our needs except Paytm and AppsFlyer (which we decided to <a href="https://github.com/elanic-tech">build</a> ourselves).</p>

<p>As for performance, the standard RN constructs were performant enough for our needs. One issue was the grid view required to support variable-width views on our home page. However, By using some flexbox and ListView tricks, we were able to render <a href="https://github.com/yelled3/react-native-grid-example">a fairly performant grid view</a>.</p>

<p>Confident about the RN ecosystem, we set out to develop our iOS app. It took us almost 5 months to get from idea to product and, after a lot of moving fast and breaking things, we finally launched our app in November.</p>

<h3 id="codestructure">Code Structure</h3>

<p>After a fair bit of refactoring, we settled on a one-way data flow using redux as a central state for the app.</p>

<ol>
<li>The views would listen for user interactions and dispatch <a href="https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk">thunks</a> (we're now moving business logic to <a href="https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga">sagas</a>).  </li>
<li>The thunks would asynchronously handle network requests and dispatch the necessary actions to change state.  </li>
<li>The actions would trigger the corresponding reducers which would update the state. <br>
We use Immutable.js for the central state and the benefits that their persistent immutable objects give us works nicely with <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/optimizing-performance.html#using-immutable-data-structures">the react rendering logic</a> as they allow us to track state changes across the app cheaply (by reference comparison) and update only those elements that have changed.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="automating">Automating</h3>

<p>There are several tedious processes in app development that lend itself temptingly to automation. In our case, they included:</p>

<ol>
<li>Adding a new screen/component.  </li>
<li>Adding a new branch to the app state and associated actions/reducers.  </li>
<li>Compiling the app and deploying to beta and later promoting to production. <br>
We handled 1 and 2 by adding custom shell scripts to automate new file additions. 3 was handled with the help of <a href="https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane">fastlane</a> and <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/">CodePush</a>.  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="buildanddeploycycle">Build and deploy cycle</h3>

<p>Fastlane allowed us to automate the deploy of new versions so we could focus on building the app. It remains an invaluable tool when we add new native features but for all non-native features, we use CodePush.</p>

<p>CodePush allowed us to push new features to test devices and then, to our users directly. This was invaluable in our early versions as we worked around the clock to push and deploy bug fixes to live devices. Today, CodePush is what allows us to push new features directly to devices (without waiting for an app store review). By using a suitable semantic versioning scheme, we can track the segmentation of our users and deploy accordingly.  </p>

<h3 id="future">Future</h3>

<p>Recently, we've been working on developing a web app from the same codebase as we can re-use most of the business logic and states/reducers. The only difference would be the view logic which would be suited for the web. Using web-pack, we can selectively compile for web and iOS by naming the file *.web.js or *.ios.js. Thus differing in only the view logic and the build process, the same developers can contribute code to both web and mobile.</p>

<p>So that's been the story of our experience with React Native. I hope our mistakes and choices can help others make better decisions. We're on the lookout for some good React developers so do apply if youâ€™re interested.</p>
